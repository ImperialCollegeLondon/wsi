        """Sewer node that has a QueueTank and storage capacity. Think carefully about
        parameterising this tank, because of course the amount of water that can flow
        through a sewer in a timestep is different in reality than in a.

        steady state (e.g., a sewer that can handle a peak of 6m3/s in practice could
        not handle 6 * 86400 m3 of water in a day because that water does not flow
        uniformly over the day).

        Args:
            name (str): node name
            capacity (float, optional): Sewer tank capacity. Defaults to 0.
            pipe_time (float, optional): Number of timesteps to spend in the queue of
                the sewer tank. Defaults to 0.
            pipe_timearea (dict, optional): Time area diagram that enables flows to
                take a range of different durations to 'traverse' the tank. The keys
                of the dict are the number of timesteps while the values are the
                proportion of flow. E.g., {0 : 0.7, 1 : 0.3} means 70% of flow takes
                0 timesteps and 30% takes 1 timesteps.
            chamber_area (float, optional): Sewer tank area. Defaults to 1.
            chamber_floor (float, optional): Sewer tank datum. Defaults to 10.
            data_input_dict (dict, optional): Dictionary of data inputs relevant for
                the node (though I don't think it is used). Defaults to {}.

        NOTE that currently the queuetank either applies the pipe_timearea
        (push_set_land) OR the pipe_time (push_set_sewer). Though this behaviour
        could be changed by setting the number_of_timesteps property to pipe_time of
        the sewer_tank and removing the pipe_time setting in push_set_sewer.

        Functions intended to call in orchestration:
            make_discharge

        Key assumptions:
            - Sewer networks can be represented in an aggregated manner, where
                the behaviour of collections of manholes/pipes can be captured
                in a single component.
            - Travel time of water received from either `land.py/Land` objects
                or `demand.py/Demand` objects is assumed to be received as a
                non-point source and thus can be represented with the time-area
                method.
            - Travel time of water from an upstream `Sewer` object has a fixed
                travel time through the node.
            - The flow capacity of sewer network can be represented as with a
                `Tank`.
            - The `Sewer` object is not currently biochemically active.

        Input data and parameter requirements:
            - `pipe_timearea` is a dictionary containing the timearea diagram.
                _Units_: duration of flow (in timesteps) and proportion of flow
            - `pipe_time` describes the travel time of water received from upstream
                `Sewer`
                objects.
                _Units_: number of timesteps
            - `capacity`, `chamber_area`, `chamber_datum` describe the dimensions of the
                `Tank` that controls flow.
                _Units_: cubic metres, squared metres, metres
