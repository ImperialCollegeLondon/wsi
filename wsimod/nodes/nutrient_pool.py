            (fraction of fast pool to dissolved organic pool). Defaults to {'N' :
            0.000003, 'P' : 0.0000001}. immobdpar (dict, optional): reference
            immobilisation rate (fraction of dissolved inorganic pool to fast pool).
            Defaults to {'N' : 0.0056, 'P' : 0.2866}.
            fraction_manure_to_dissolved_inorganic (dict, optional): fraction of
            nutrients from applied manure to dissolved inorganic pool, with the rest
            added to the fast pool. Defaults to {'N' : 0.5, 'P' : 0.1}.
            fraction_residue_to_fast (dict, optional): fraction of nutrients from
            residue to fast pool, with the rest added to the humus pool. Defaults to
            {'N' : 0.1, 'P' : 0.1}.

        Key assumptions:
             - Four nutrient pools are conceptualised for both nitrogen and phosphorus
                in soil, which includes humus pool, fast pool, dissolved inorganic pool,
                and dissolved organic pool. Humus and fast pool represent immobile pool
                of organic nutrients in the soil with slow and fast turnover,
                respectively. Dissolved inorganic and organic pool represent nutrients
                in dissolved phase in soil water (for phosphorus, dissolved organic pool
                might contain particulate phase). Given that phoshphorus can be adsorbed
                and attached to soil particles, an adsorbed inorganic pool is created
                specifically for phosphorus.
             - The major sources of nutrients to soil are conceptualised as
                - atmospheric deposition:
                    - dry deposition:
                        - for nitrogen, inorganic fraction of dry deposition is added to
                          the dissovled
                           inorganic pool, while the rest is added to the fast pool;
                        - for phosphorus, all is added to adsorbed inorganic pool.
                    - wet deposition: all is added to the dissolved inorganic pool.
                - fertilisers: all added to the dissolved inorganic pool.
                - manure: the inorganic fraction is added to the dissovled inorganic
                  pool, with
                    the rest added to the fast pool.
                - residue: the part with fast turnover is added to the fast pool, with
                  the rest
                    added to the humus pool.
             - Nutrient fluxes between these pools are simulated to represent the
               biochemical processes
                that can transform the nutrients between different forms. These
                processes include - degradation of humus pool to fast pool - dissolution
                of humus pool to dissovled organic pool - mineralisation of fast pool to
                dissolved inorganic pool - dissolution of fast pool to dissolved organic
                pool - immobilisation of dissolved inroganic pool to fast pool The rate
                of these processes are affected by the soil temperature and moisture
                conditions.
             - When soil erosion happens, a portion of both the adsorbed inorganic pool
               and humus pool
                for phosphorus will be eroded as well.
