        subsurface flow, rural runoff, urban drainage, pollution deposition). The
        expected use is that each distinctive type of land cover (different crop types,
        gardens, forests, impervious urban drainage, etc.) each have a Surface object,
        which is a subclass of Tank. The land node will iterate over its surfaces each
        timestep, which will generally (except in the case of an impervious surface)
        send water to three common Tanks: surface flow, subsurface flow and percolation.
        These tanks will then send flows to rivers or groundwater.

        surfaces)

        Args:

            percolation_residence_time (int, optional): Residence time for
                percolation flow (see nodes.py/ResidenceTank). Defaults to 50.
            surface_residence_time (int, optional): Residence time for surface flow
                (see nodes.py/ResidenceTank). Defaults to 1.
            surfaces (list, optional): list of dicts where each dict describes the
                parameters of each surface in the Land node. Each dict also contains an
                entry under 'type_' which describes which subclass of surface to use.
                Defaults to [].
            data_input_dict (dict, optional): Dictionary of data inputs relevant for
                the node (generally, et0, precipitation and temperature). Keys are
                tuples where first value is the name of the variable to read from the
                dict and the second value is the time. Defaults to {}.

        Functions intended to call in orchestration:
            run apply_irrigation (if used)

        Key assumptions:
             - Percolation, surface runoff, and subsurface runoff, can be described with
                a residence-time method.
             - Flows to percolation, surface runoff, and subsurface runoff are
                generated by different hydrological response units (subclasses of
                `land.py/Surface`), but aggregated for a given land node.
             - Flows to percolation are distributed to `storage.py/Groundwater`
                nodes while surface/subsurface runoff to `nodes.py/Node` or
                `storage.py/River` nodes.
             - Input data associated with the land node (precipitation,
                temperature, evapotranspiartion) are the same for every surface.
             - Water received from `sewer.py/Sewer` objects is sent to the first
                `land.py/ImperviousSurface` in the surfaces list.

        Input data and parameter requirements:
             - Precipitation and evapotranspiration are in the `data_input_dict`
                at the model timestep. _Units_: metres/timestep
             - Temperature in the `data_input_dict` at the model timestep.
                _Units_: C
             - Residence time of surface, subsurface and percolation flows.

                surface runoff from the parent Land node. Defaults to 0.5.
            surface_coefficient (float, optional): If flow is generated, the proportion
                of flow that goes to surface runoff. Defaults to 0.05.
            percolation_coefficient (float, optional): If flow is generated, then the
                proportion of water that does not go to surface runoff that goes to
                percolation (i.e., groundwater) - the remainder goes to subsurface
                runoff. Defaults to 0.75.
            et0_coefficient (float, optional): Convert between the parent nodes data

                ephemeral stream this parameter probably can stay high. Defaults to 10.

        Key assumptions:
             - In IHACRES, the maximum infiltration per time step is controlled by an
                infiltration capacity, beyond which the precipitation will flow directly
                as surface runoff.
             - Evapotranspiration and effective precipitation are calculated based on
                soil moisture content.
             - Effective precipitation is then divided into percolation, surface runoff,
                and subsurface runoff by multiplying the corresponding coefficient.
             - Percolation, surface runoff, and subsurface runoff are sent into the
                corresponding residence tanks for rounting to downstream.
             - The mass of pollutants in soil water tank proportionately leaves the
                soil water tank into the routing residence tanks. Evapotranspiration can
                only bring out water, with pollutants left in the soil tank.

        """Extensive surface subclass that implements the CatchWat equations (Liu,
        Dobson & Mijic (2022) Science of the total environment), which in turn are
        primarily based on FAO document:
        https://www.fao.org/3/x0490e/x0490e0ehtm#soil%20water%20availability. This
        surface is a pervious surface that also has things that grow on it. This
        behaviour includes soil nutrient pools, crop planting/harvest calendars,
        erosion, crop behaviour.

        A key complexity of this surface is the nutrient pool (see wsimod/nodes/
        nutrient_pool.py), which is a class that tracks the amount of phosphorus and
        nitrogen in different states and performs transformations that occur in the
        phosphorus/nitrogen cycle. It is assumed that the phosphate/nitrate/nitrite/
        ammonia amounts in this Surface tank should track the dissolved inorganic pool
        in the nutrient pool. Meanwhile, the org-phosphorus/org-nitrogen amounts in this
        tank should track the dissolved organic pool in the nutrient pool. The total
        amount of pollutants that enter this tank may not be the same as the total
        amount that leave, because pollutants are transformed between inorganic/ organic
        and between wet/dry states - these transformations are accounted for in mass
        balance.

        For users to quickly enable/disable these nutrient processes, which are
        computationally intensive (in current case studies they account for about half
        of the total runtime), they are only active if 'nitrate' is one of the modelled
        pollutants. Note that the code will not check if nitrite/phosphate/
        org-phosphorus/org-nitrogen/ammonia are also included, but they should be if
        nitrate is included and otherwise the code will crash with a key error.

        Args:
            rooting_depth (float, optional): Depth of the soil tank (i.e., how deep do
                crop roots go). Defaults to 1.
            ET_depletion_factor (float, optional): Average fraction of soil that can be
                depleted from the root zone before moisture stress (reduction in ET)
                occurs. Defaults to 1.
            crop_factor_stages (list, optional): Crop factor is a multiplier on et0,
                more grown plants have higher transpiration and higher crop factors.
                This list shows changing crop factor at different times of year in
                relation to crop_factor_stage_dates. See wsimod/preprocessing/
                england_data_formatting.py/format_surfaces for further details on
                formulating these - since the interpolation used to find crop_factors in
                between the given values in the list is a bit involved. Defaults to
                [1,1].
            crop_factor_stage_dates (list, optional): Dates associated with
                crop_factor_stages. Defaults to [0, 365].
            sowing_day (int, optional): day of year that crops are sown. Defaults to 1.
            harvest_day (int, optional): day of year that crops are harvest. Defaults
                to 365.
            initial_soil_storage (dict or float, optional): Initial mass of solid
            pollutants
                in the soil nutrient pools (fast and adsorbed inorganic pools)

        Key assumptions:
             - In the soil water module, crop stages and crop coefficients control the
               evapotranspiration.
             - Fertiliser and manure application are the major source of soil nutrients,
               which are added
                into soil nutrient pools, including dissovled inorganic, dissolved
                organic, fast and humus for both nitrogen and phosphorus.
             - Nutrient transformation processes in soil are simulated, including fluxes
               between the soil
                nutrient pools, denitrification for nitrogen, adsorption/desorption for
                phosphorus. These processes are affected by temperature and soil
                moisture.
             - Crop uptake of nutrients are simulated based on crop stages, which is
               different for spring-sown
                and autumn-sown crops.
             - Soil erosion from the growing surface is simulated as one of the major
               sources of suspended solids
                in rivers, which is mainly affected by rainfall energy and crop/ground
                cover. Phosphorus will also be eroded along with the soil particles, in
                both adsorbed inorganic and humus form.

        Input data and parameter requirements:
             - `data_input_dict` can contain a variety of pollutant deposition data.
                `srp-fertiliser` describes phosphate. `noy-fertiliser` describes
                nitrogen as nitrates. `nhx-fertiliser` describes nitrogen as ammonia.
                `srp/noy/ nhx-manure` can also be used to specify manure application.
