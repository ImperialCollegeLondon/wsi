  summary: WSIMOD is a software for simulating water quality and quantity.
  type: model
  publisher: Imperial College London
  description: >
    The terrestrial water cycle is a highly interconnected system where the movement of
    water is affected by physical and human processes. Thus, environmental models may
    become inaccurate if they do not provide a complete picture of the water cycle,
    missing out on unexpected opportunities and omitting impacts that arise from complex
    interactions.

    WSIMOD is a modelling framework to integrate these different processes. It provides
    a message passing interface to enable different subsystem models to communicate
    water flux and water quality information between each other, and self-contained
    representations of the key parts of the water cycle (rivers, reservoirs, urban and
    rural hydrological catchments, treatment plants, and pipe networks).
