# Welcome to WSIMOD

WSIMOD stands for the Water Systems Integrated Modelling framework.

The terrestrial water cycle is a highly interconnected system where the 
movement of water is affected by physical and human processes. Thus, 
environmental models may become inaccurate if they do not provide a complete 
picture of the water cycle, missing out on unexpected opportunities and 
omitting impacts that arise from complex interactions. WSIMOD is a modelling 
framework to integrate these different processes. It provides a message passing 
interface to enable different subsystem models to communicate water flux and 
water quality information between each other, and self-contained 
representations of the key parts of the water cycle (rivers, reservoirs, urban 
and rural hydrological catchments, treatment plants, and pipe networks).
We created WSIMOD to enable a user greater flexibility in setting up their 
water cycle models, motivated by the abundance of non-textbook water systems 
that we have experienced in industry collaboration. The WSIMOD Python package 
provides tutorials and examples to help modellers create nodes, connect them 
with arcs, and create simulations.
