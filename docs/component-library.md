## Introduction

WSIMOD contains a variety of components to represent physical processes.
We recommend viewing the [API](#reference) for a detailed description of the
models included, however, we provide an overview of documented
components, their assumptions and required input data on this page.

Humus and fast pool represent immobile pool of organic nutrients in the soil with slow and fast turnover, respectively. Dissolved inorganic and organic pool represent nutrients in dissolved phase in soil water (for phosphorus, dissolved organic pool might contain particulate phase). Given that phoshphorus can be adsorbed and attached to soil particles, an adsorbed inorganic pool is created specifically for phosphorus.<br> - The major sources of nutrients to soil are conceptualised as<br> - atmospheric deposition:<br> - dry deposition:<br> - for nitrogen, inorganic fraction of dry deposition is added to the dissovled inorganic pool, while the rest is added to the fast pool;<br> - for phosphorus, all is added to adsorbed inorganic pool.<br> - wet deposition: all is added to the dissolved inorganic pool.<br> - fertilisers: all added to the dissolved inorganic pool.<br> - manure: the inorganic fraction is added to the dissovled inorganic pool, with the rest added to the fast pool.<br> - residue: the part with fast turnover is added to the fast pool, with the rest added to the humus pool.<br> - Nutrient fluxes between these pools are simulated to represent the biochemical processes that can transform the nutrients between different forms.
